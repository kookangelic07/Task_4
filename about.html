         <h1>About Me</h1>
         <hr />
        <p>A precursor character with the name "Honey Bunny" first appeared in the Bugs Bunny's Album comic book in 1953. That character was depicted as Bugs' cousin, and was an explorer.The name was reused for a separate character intended as Bugs' love interest, who debuted in Bugs Bunny Comic Book number 108 on November 15, 1966. Robert McKimson designed the prototype version of the character with Phil DeLara redesigning Honey and using her as a semi-regular in the Looney Tunes Gold Key Comics in the 1960s.</p>
        <p>Honey's physical appearance varied over time. She was originally drawn with lop ears with a bow and pale yellow-tan fur. A female rabbit resembling this design appears at the end of the 1979 television special Bugs Bunny's Thanksgiving Diet. Later merchandise using the character depicted her as more closely resembling Bugs, with grey fur but a more visibly feminine model and clothing, which was used until the early 1990s. She also made several video game cameos such as The Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle, Bugs Bunny's Birthday Ball, and The Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle 2. Honey was also mentioned in the book Looney Tunes: The Official Visual Guide.</p>
        <p>In the mid-1990s, Warner Bros. started working on Space Jam (1996). There were plans to feature Honey Bunny. Some artists commented that Honey looked too much like Bugs, and eventually created Lola Bunny as a replacement.</p>
